- Unfortunately, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. For 90398   retirements, 1549 employees are eligible for mentorship. Which means additional 88849 candidates would be needed for the rest of the positions.
